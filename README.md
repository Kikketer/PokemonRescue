# PokemonRescue

General idea is to make an "animal rescue" but use Pokemon monsters.  Ginny loves Pokemon but doesn't want them to fight and she loves to take care of animals and the like.

## Goals:
1. Have Pokemon in "pens" inside a type of barn
2. When you interact with a pen, you see the single (only one for now) pokemon in the pen and it's stats
3. From there you can decide to feed it, pet it, or let it play outside
4. Each pokemon will have stats including Hunger and Happiness
  - Hunger affected by food, each "tick" will increase hunger
  - Happiness affected by pets and play, each "tick" will decrease happiness
5. The ultimate goal for each Pokemon is to be adopted
  - Pokemon that are healthy and happy are more likely to be adopted + RND
6. New Pokemon will be brought in based on if all the pens are full and RND
